Hi this is Amit Kapoor
I'm learning DevOps for getting new work or job
I'm learning this by watching videos of Bhupinder Sir
He is very good person and his teaching method is so good
One of my friend encouraged me to do DevOps
He suggested me to watch the videos of Bhupinder sir
i was impressed by his teaching method and decided to learn DevOps
He has a good command over DevOps
Working as DevOps engineer is nice feeling
I hope i will complete this course soon
And after that with the help of my good friends i'll get a good job or work from home
Two of my friends gave me a suggestions to do this course
Hope they will help me to find out the work related to this
